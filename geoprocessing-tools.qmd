## Overview

Much like a python geoprocessing (GP) script tool, R based script tools can be created
allowing you to create GP tools and toolboxes that utilize the power of R. 
The basic anatomy of an R script GP tool is like so:

```{.r filename="my-geoprocessing-tool.R"}
tool_exec <- function(in_params, out_params) { # <1>
  # ... do things here.. 
  out_params #<2>
}
```
1. Two arguments capture input and output parameters
2. Output parameters are returned to be captured by Pro

GP R script tools are defined in a standalone R script. The GP tool is defined 
by a function called `tool_exec()`. `tool_exec()` take two and only two 
arguments capturing input and output parameters. `tool_exec()` should always 
return the output parameter argument. 

## Input and Output Parameters

Additionally, there must be two arguments that  correspond to input 
parameters and output parameters. The conventional name of 
these arguments are `in_params` and `out_params`. The first argument will 
_always_ refer to the input parameters and the second to the outputs.

`in_params` and `out_params` are named lists. The elements of these lists are
determined by the **direction** of a parameter. 

![](images/gp-tool-properties.png){width=50%}

If the direction is `Input` it will be contained in `in_params`. Likewise, 
if the direction is `Output`, it will be contained in `out_params`. 

## Using parameters

We can extract values from the `in_params` and `out_params` lists by the name
of the parameter. 

:::{.callout-caution}
The name of the parameter must match that of the **Name** column in the `Parameters` 
option of the Tool Properties. _It is not_ the Label column.
:::

For example, if we wanted to parse the `date` parameter we could write our
function like so: 

```r
tool_exec <- function(in_params, out_params) {
  # fetch the date parameter
  date_str <- in_params[["date"]]
  
  # parse it using {anytime}
  clean_date <- anytime::anytime(date_str)
  
  # ... do additional things
  
  # return values to ArcGIS Pro
  out_params
}
```

### Returning values to ArcGIS Pro

You may have noticed that at the end of the `tool_exec()` function we are 
returning the `out_params` object. If we do not return the output parameters 
back to Pro—by returning `out_params`—the outputs cannot be captured and used
by Pro. 

Notably, the output parameters are useful in linking one tool to another, for
example via use in [ModelBuilder](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/geoprocessing/modelbuilder/modelbuilder-quick-tour.htm) or in an [**`arcpy`**](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/main/arcgis-pro-arcpy-reference.htm) script. 

See [Using R script tools with **`arcpy`**](#arcpy-integration)

### Parameter types

There are number of different type of parameters that can be provided to a 
geoprocessing (GP) tool. The type of parameter that is chosen determines how 
that parameter will appear in the GP pane's UI. Each parameter type can be 
represented by a basic scalar R type: `integer`, `double`, `character`, `logical`, or 
`NULL`.

:::{.callout-tip}
A scalar value is a vector with only a single element. 
:::


It is incumbent upon you to take these parameter inputs and use them appropriately in R. Not every type of parameter can be processed correctly by `arcgisbinding`. Below are some of the most common parameter types and how they are handled by `arcgisbinding`. This is not a complete enumeration by any means! 

| Parameter Data Type | R type |
| --------- | ------ | 
| String | `character` |
| Boolean | `logical` |
| Double | `numeric` |
| Date | `character` in the format of your system e.g. `"11/17/2023 4:35:57 PM"` |
| Field | `character` the field name of a feature class |
| Folder | `character` absolute path e.g. `"C:\\Users\username\Documents"` |
| Feature Class | `character`absolute path e.g. `"C:\\Users\username\mydatabase.gdb\\feature_class` |
| Spatial Reference | `character` a string representation of the spatial reference e.g. `"PROJCS["...."]"` |

### Multiple Values

When selecting the `Multiple values` check box in the parameter data type UI, users 
can then provide multiple inputs of that type. 

![](images/gp-parameter-type.png)

When this is done, each of the input values will be contained inside of a list. If you have multiple values ticked for the `String` type, you will get a list of scalar character vectors.

**This is important** so it bears repeating! When users provide multiple values they will
be captured in R as a list of scalars. Meaning that if you have multiple `String` values 
you will not get a character vector with a length greater than one. 

Take the below input for example

![](images/gp-multiple-strings.png)

In R we would get the `list("string 1", "string 2")` and **not** `c("string 1", "string 2")`.

:::{.callout-tip}
To turn a list of scalars of the same type—e.g. double, integer, logical, or character—into a vector you can use `unlist()`. For example `unlist(list("string 1", "string 2"))` will give us `c("string 1", "string 2")`.

## Common Patterns

### Reading a Feature Class

Often we you will want to read a feature class using `arcgisbinding` and bring the results into R as an sf object. To do his we will use the functions `arc.open()`, `arc.select()`, and `arc.data2sf()`.

```r
tool_exec <- function(in_params, out_params) {

  fclass <- arcgisbinding::arc.open(in_params[["fc_path"]])
  
  fclass_selected <- arcgisbinding::arc.select(
    fclass,
    # fields = c("optional", "fields", "to", "read"),
    # where_clause = "optional sql where clause to filter"
  )
  
  fclass_sf <- arcgisbinding::arc.data2sf(fclass_selected)
}
```

:::{.callout-note}
If you are going to filter or select columns from your dataset consider doing that with the `fields` and `where_clause` arguments of `arc.select()` to reduce the amount of data read into memory. 

`arc.select()` returns a `data.frame` with fields and a special geometry column which is incompatible with sf. We use `arc.data2sf()` to convert it to an sf object.
:::


### Writing a Feature Class

It is quite common to write the results of an analysis to a file geodatabase. This can be done with `arc.write()`. Typically, the we will capture the output path to write to in the `out_params` list object as a Feature Class type parameter. 

`arc.write()` requires two arguments. The first is the output path to write to and the second is the object to write. The accepted type of objects are `data.frame`, `sf`, `RasterLayer` or `RasterBrick`. 

:::{.callout-note}
As of Nov 2023 `{terra}` is not supported but we are actively working on this.
:::

```r
tool_exec <- function(in_params, out_params) {
  
  # extract the path to write to
  out_fp <- out_params[["output_fclass"]]
  
  # write the `sf_object` to a geodatabase
  arcgisbinding::arc.write(out_fp, sf_object)
  
}
```


### Installing Required Packages 

When you share your R based GP tools with other users there is a good chance that they do not have the packages that your script tool needs to execute code. In this case, we should install the required packages the first time the script tool is executed. 

In our script tool we should check to see if the required package is installed and if not, install it. We can write a helper function to include at the top of our script if we have multiple packages to check. 

```r
install_if_not <- function(pkg) {
  if (!requireNamespace(pkg)) {
    message("Installing required package `{", pkg, "}`")
    install.packages(pkg)
  }
}
```

This function uses `requireNamespace()` which attempts to load the provided package. If it succeeds, it returns `TRUE`, if not it returns `FALSE`. We check to see if it returns `FALSE` and if so, we install the package and print an informative message. 

For example if we need to use the package [`{spdep}`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/) and its not installed it will print the message and install it.

```r
tool_exec <- function(in_params, out_params) {
  # check for required paackages 
  install_if_not("spdep")
  
  # do other thigns with spdep
  # ...
}
```

## Using Progressors 

Geoprocessing tools have a progressor, which includes both a progress label and a progress bar. The default progressor continuously moves back and forth to indicate the script is running. Using `arc.progress_label()` and `arc.progress_pos()` allows fine control over the script progress. Updating the progressor isn’t necessary, but is useful in situations where solely outputting messages to the dialog is insufficient to communicate script progress.

:::

Using `arc.progress_label()` allows control over the label that is displayed at the top of the running script. For example, it might be used to display the current step of the analysis taking place. Using `arc.progress_pos()` allows control over the progressor position displayed at the top of the running script. The position is an integer percentage, 0 to 100, that the progress bar should be set to, with 100 indicating the script has completed (100%).


```r
library(arcgisbinding)

tool_exec <- function(in_params, out_params) {
  
  # read feature class 
  arc.progress_label("Reading Feature Class")
  fclass <- arc.open(in_params[["input_fclass"]])
  
  # convert to sf
  arc.progress_label("Converting Feature Class to sf")
  sf_obj <- arc.data2sf(arc.select(fclass))
  
  # do other things 
  arc.progress_label("Doing other computations")
  
  return(out_params)
}
```
