The R-ArcGIS Bridge supports working with both ArcGIS Pro as well as ArcGIS location services.

# Using ArcGIS location services

The R-ArcGIS Bridge R packages that interact with location services are contained in the metapackage [arcgis](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgis/). It contains:

- [`{arcgisutils}`](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisutils): manages authorization for all location service R packages and other utilities
- [`{arcgislayers}`](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgislayers): provides read and write access to layers on ArcGIS Online, Enterprise, and Platform
- [`{arcgisgeocode}`](https://github.com/r-arcgis/arcgisgeocode): geocode addresses and reverse geocode point data
- [`{arcgisplaces}`](https://github.com/r-arcgis/arcgisplaces): access rich point-of-interest data from the ArcGIS Places Service


## Install the R packages 

To install the packages run: 

```r
install.packages("arcgis")
```

Once the installation has finished you can load all of the packages using

```r
library(arcgis)
```

Or, you can install the packages individually as well by running: 

```r
pkgs <- c("arcgisutils", "arcgislayers", "arcgisgeocode", "arcgisplaces")

install.packages(pkgs)
```
