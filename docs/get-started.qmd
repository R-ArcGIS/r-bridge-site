The R-ArcGIS Bridge supports working with both ArcGIS Pro as well as ArcGIS location services.

# Using ArcGIS location services

The R-ArcGIS Bridge R packages that interact with location services are contained in the metapackage ['{arcgis}'](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgis/). It contains: 

- [`{arcgisutils}`](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisutils): manages authorization for all location service R packages and other utilities
- [`{arcgislayers}`](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgislayers): provides read and write access to layers on ArcGIS Online, Enterprise, and Platform
- [`{arcgisgeocode}`](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisgeocode): geocode addresses and reverse geocode point data
- [`{arcgisplaces}`](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisplaces): access rich point-of-interest data from the ArcGIS Places Service
