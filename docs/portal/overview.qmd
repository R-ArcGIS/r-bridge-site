The `{arcgisutils}` package provides utility functions for working with ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise portals. Portal functionality enables you to interact with users, groups, and content items programmatically from R.

:::{.callout-note}
Portal-related function documentation is available in the [API Reference](https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/api-reference/arcgisutils/#portal)

## Portal Functionality

The R-ArcGIS Bridge provides functions to:

| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `arc_user()` | Get information about a specific user by username or ID |
| `arc_user_self()` | Get information about the currently authenticated user |
| `arc_portal_users()` | List all users in a portal |
| `arc_group()` | Get information about a specific group by ID |
| `arc_user_content()` | List content items owned by a user |
| `arc_group_content()` | List content items shared with a group |
| `search_items()` | Search for content items using full-text search |

## Authentication

Most portal-related functionality requires authentication to your portal. Before working with portal functions, you need to obtain an access token.

:::{.callout-caution}
If you have not yet set up your R environment for authentication, see the [Authentication section](xref:///authentication-overview). Ensure that the environment variables. If you are using ArcGIS Enterprise, ensure that `ARCGIS_HOST` is properly set.
:::

To authenticate as yourself and set the token for your session:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(arcgisutils)

# Set the token for the entire session
set_arc_token(auth_user())
```

:::{.callout-tip}
Using `set_arc_token()` makes the authentication token available for all subsequent portal operations in your R session, so you don't need to pass the token to each function call.

## Working with Portal Objects

Portal functions return specially formatted objects that contain metadata about users, groups, and content items:

- **`PortalUser`**: Contains user profile information, groups, and settings
- **`PortalGroup`**: Contains group metadata, membership info, and sharing settings
- **`PortalItem`**: Contains item metadata like title, type, owner, and URL

These objects are lists with custom print methods that display key information in a user-friendly format. You can access individual fields using standard list notation (e.g., `user$username`, `group$title`).
