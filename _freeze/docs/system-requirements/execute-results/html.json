However, we recommend updating your R version whenever possible to keep up with enhancements, features, and any security updates.\n\n# Dependencies\nThe `{arcgis}` meta-package consists of many smaller R packages, each of these with different R package dependencies. However, all of them share a dependency on `{arcgisutils}`.\n\n`{arcgisutils}` is built in part using Rust via [extendr](https://extendr.github.io/). We recommend installing a binary from the [R-universe](https://r-arcgis.r-universe.dev/) or CRAN.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"arcgis\", repos = \"https://r-arcgis.r-universe.dev\")\n```\n:::\n\nIf you need to install from source, `rustc` must be available with a minimum version of 1.69. We encourage using the most recent version of `rustc`.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nWe recommend installing Rust via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/). If you are on Windows, you must add the Windows GNU target via `rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.\n:::",
