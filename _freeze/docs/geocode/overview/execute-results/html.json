Addresses represent a geographical place but lack geographic data.\n\nThe package `{arcgisgeocode}` enables you to search for an address (geocode), reverse geocode, find candidate matches, get suggestions, and batch geocode. Geocoding is the process of converting text to an address and a location.\n\n- **Address geocoding**, also known as forward geocoding, is the process of converting text for an address to a complete address with a location.\n- **Place geocoding** is the process of searching for addresses for businesses, administrative locations, and geographic features.\n- **Reverse geocoding** is the process of converting a point to an address or place.\n- **Batch geocoding**, also known as bulk geocoding, is the process of converting a list of addresses or place names to a set of complete addresses with locations.\n\n# Licensing considerations\n\nMany features of the ArcGIS World Geocoder are provided for free such as forward geocoding, reverse geocoding, and place search. However, **storing results is not free**. Additionally, the bulk geocoding functionality requires a developer account or available credits. \n\nIn order to store results, each function has an argument `for_storage` which should be set to `TRUE` if you intend to store the results. \n\nTo learn more about free and paid geocoding operations refer to the [storage parameter documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/geocoding/services/geocoding-service/#storage-parameter).\n\n| Function | Description | Free |\n| -------- | ----------- | ---- |\n| `find_address_candidates()` | Finds up to 50 location candidates based on a provided address. _This function is vectorized_ to work with many addresses at a time. | ✅ |\n| `reverse_geocode()` | Returns an address based on the provided coordinate. _This function is vectorized_ to work with many locations at a time. | ✅ |\n| `suggest_places()` | Returns possible POI information based on a location and a search phrase. This function is not vectorized. | ✅ |\n| `geocoded_addresses()` | Bulk geocodes addresses returning a single location per address. Use this for highly performant and scalable address geocoding. | ❌ |\n\n\n# Get started\n\nTo start geocoding with the R-ArcGIS Bridge, install the R package from CRAN. \n\n\n\n\n```r\n# install from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"arcgisgeocode\")\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the library\nlibrary(arcgisgeocode)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Geocode an address\n\nPerform single address geocoding using the `find_address_candidates()` function.
