It is not the Label column.\n\n\nFor example, if we wanted to parse the date parameter we could write our function like so:\ntool_exec &lt;- function(in_params, out_params) {\n  # fetch the date parameter\n  date_str &lt;- in_params[[\"date\"]]\n  \n  # parse it using {anytime}\n  clean_date &lt;- anytime::anytime(date_str)\n  \n  # ... do additional things\n  \n  # return values to ArcGIS Pro\n  out_params\n}\n\nReturning values to ArcGIS Pro\nYou may have noticed that at the end of the tool_exec() function we are returning the out_params object. If we do not return the output parameters back to Pro—by returning out_params—the outputs cannot be captured and used by Pro.\nNotably, the output parameters are useful in linking one tool to another, for example via use in ModelBuilder or in an arcpy script.\nSee Using R script tools with arcpy\n\n\nParameter types\nThere are number of different type of parameters that can be provided to a geoprocessing (GP) tool. The type of parameter that is chosen determines how that parameter will appear in the GP pane’s UI. Each parameter type can be represented by a basic scalar R type: integer, double, character, logical, or NULL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA scalar value is a vector with only a single element.\n\n\nIt is incumbent upon you to take these parameter inputs and use them appropriately in R. Not every type of parameter can be processed correctly by arcgisbinding. Below are some of the most common parameter types and how they are handled by arcgisbinding. This is not a complete enumeration by any means!\n\nData type mapping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter Data Type\nR type\n\n\n\n\nString\ncharacter\n\n\nBoolean\nlogical\n\n\nDouble\nnumeric\n\n\nDate\ncharacter in the format of your system e.g. \"11/17/2023 4:35:57 PM\"\n\n\nField\ncharacter the field name of a feature class\n\n\nFolder\ncharacter absolute path e.g. \"C:\\\\Users\\username\\Documents\"\n\n\nFeature Class\ncharacterabsolute path e.g. \"C:\\\\Users\\username\\mydatabase.gdb\\\\feature_class\n\n\nSpatial Reference\ncharacter a string representation of the spatial reference e.g. \"PROJCS[\"....\"]\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Values\nWhen selecting the Multiple values check box in the parameter data type UI, users can then provide multiple inputs of that type.\n\nWhen this is done, each of the input values will be contained inside of a list. If you have multiple values ticked for the String type, you will get a list of scalar character vectors.\nThis is important so it bears repeating! When users provide multiple values they will be captured in R as a list of scalars. Meaning that if you have multiple String values you will not get a character vector with a length greater than one.\nTake the below input for example\n\nIn R we would get the list(\"string 1\", \"string 2\") and not c(\"string 1\", \"string 2\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo turn a list of scalars of the same type—e.g. double, integer, logical, or character—into a vector you can use unlist(). For example unlist(list(\"string 1\", \"string 2\")) will give us c(\"string 1\", \"string 2\")."

    "section": "Common Patterns",
    "text": "Common Patterns\n\nReading a Feature Class\nOften we you will want to read a feature class using arcgisbinding and bring the results into R as an sf object. To do his we will use the functions arc.open(), arc.select(), and arc.data2sf().\ntool_exec &lt;- function(in_params, out_params) {\n\n  fclass &lt;- arcgisbinding::arc.open(in_params[[\"fc_path\"]])\n  \n  fclass_selected &lt;- arcgisbinding::arc.select(\n    fclass,\n    # fields = c(\"optional\", \"fields\", \"to\", \"read\"),\n    # where_clause = \"optional sql where clause to filter\"\n  )\n  \n  fclass_sf &lt;- arcgisbinding::arc.data2sf(fclass_selected)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are going to filter or select columns from your dataset consider doing that with the fields and where_clause arguments of arc.select() to reduce the amount of data read into memory.\narc.select() returns a data.frame with fields and a special geometry column which is incompatible with sf. We use arc.data2sf() to convert it to an sf object.\n\n\n\n\nWriting a Feature Class\nIt is quite common to write the results of an analysis to a file geodatabase. This can be done with arc.write(). Typically, the we will capture the output path to write to in the out_params list object as a Feature Class type parameter.\narc.write() requires two arguments. The first is the output path to write to and the second is the object to write. The accepted type of objects are data.frame, sf, RasterLayer or RasterBrick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs of Nov 2023 {terra} is not supported but we are actively working on this.\n\n\ntool_exec &lt;- function(in_params, out_params) {\n  \n  # extract the path to write to\n  out_fp &lt;- out_params[[\"output_fclass\"]]\n  \n  # write the `sf_object` to a geodatabase\n  arcgisbinding::arc.write(out_fp, sf_object)\n  \n}\n\n\nInstalling Required Packages\nWhen you share your R based GP tools with other users there is a good chance that they do not have the packages that your script tool needs to execute code. In this case, we should install the required packages the first time the script tool is executed.\nIn our script tool we should check to see if the required package is installed and if not, install it. We can write a helper function to include at the top of our script if we have multiple packages to check.\ninstall_if_not &lt;- function(pkg) {\n  if (!requireNamespace(pkg)) {\n    message(\"Installing required package `{\", pkg, \"}`\")\n    install.packages(pkg)\n  }\n}\nThis function uses requireNamespace() which attempts to load the provided package. If it succeeds, it returns TRUE, if not it returns FALSE. We check to see if it returns FALSE and if so, we install the package and print an informative message.\nFor example if we need to use the package {spdep} and its not installed it will print the message and install it.\ntool_exec &lt;- function(in_params, out_params) {\n  # check for required paackages \n  install_if_not(\"spdep\")\n  \n  # do other thigns with spdep\n  # ...\n}"

For example, it might be used to display the current step of the analysis taking place. Using arc.progress_pos() allows control over the progressor position displayed at the top of the running script. The position is an integer percentage, 0 to 100, that the progress bar should be set to, with 100 indicating the script has completed (100%).\nlibrary(arcgisbinding)\n\ntool_exec &lt;- function(in_params, out_params) {\n  \n  # read feature class \n  arc.progress_label(\"Reading Feature Class\")\n  fclass &lt;- arc.open(in_params[[\"input_fclass\"]])\n  \n  # convert to sf\n  arc.progress_label(\"Converting Feature Class to sf\")\n  sf_obj &lt;- arc.data2sf(arc.select(fclass))\n  \n  # do other things \n  arc.progress_label(\"Doing other computations\")\n  \n  return(out_params)\n}"

Fill in the environment variables ARCGIS_CLIENT and ARCGIS_SECRET from the content item we just created.\nARCGIS_CLIENT=your-client-id\nARCGIS_SECRET=your-super-secret-key\nARCGIS_HOST=https://your-portal.com/\nARCGIS_USER=your-user-name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDo not put environment variable values in quotation marks.\nIf you are using ArcGIS Online, you do not need to set the environment variable ARCGIS_HOST.\n\n\nEnvironment variables will not be set automatically. To register the new environment variables restart your R session."

If you are authorizing to an ArcGIS Enterprise portal ensure that you set the ARCGIS_HOST environment variable correctly and that you restarted your R session.\ntoken &lt;- auth_code()\nYou will be prompted to sign in to your portal.\n\nOnce you’ve signed in, copy the code that appears, and return to R. Enter the code into the console without any modifications and press enter.\n\nYour authorization will have completed.\ntoken\n#&gt; &lt;httr2_token&gt;\n#&gt; token_type: bearer\n#&gt; access_token: &lt;REDACTED&gt;\n#&gt; expires_at: 2023-03-03 13:21:40\n#&gt; refresh_token: &lt;REDACTED&gt;\n#&gt; username: your-user\n#&gt; ssl: TRUE\n#&gt; refresh_token_expires_in: 1209599\nWe now need to set this token to the ARCGIS_SECRET environment variable. We do this with set_auth_token().\nset_auth_token(token)\n#&gt; Token set to environment variable `ARCGIS_TOKEN`\n\n\nClient flow\nAlternatively, we can authorize using the client OAuth2 flow. This will authorize the application we created and not ourselves. Because of this we cannot use the client flow to create or modify content.\nThe client flow has the benefit of being non-interactive, though.\ntoken &lt;- auth_client()\nset_auth_token(token)\n#&gt; Token set to environment variable `ARCGIS_TOKEN`\n\n\nUsing ArcGIS Pro & {arcgisbinding}\nIf you are a user of ArcGIS Pro and have arcgisbinding installed, you can use auth_binding() to utilize the tokens that result from arc.check_portal(). auth_binding() has the benefit of being non-interactive and authorizes you as a user. You can use auth_binding() for non-interactive work that creates or modifies existing content.\ntoken &lt;- auth_binding()\nset_auth_token(token)\n#&gt; Token set to environment variable `ARCGIS_TOKEN`"
