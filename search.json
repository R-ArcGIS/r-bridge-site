These environment variables are:\n\nARCGIS_HOST\nARCGIS_CLIENT\nARCGIS_USER\nARCGIS_SECRET\nARCGIS_TOKEN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment variable descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARCGIS_HOST is used to to determine where authorization takes place. By default, this is \"https://www.arcgis.com\". This is because the packages, by default, interact with ArcGIS Online. To use a different portal, you will need to modify the ARCGIS_HOST path to url of that portal.\nARCGIS_USER variable is used to determine who actions are performed on behalf of. Notably, it is used in functions that modify or create resource such as functions from arcgislayers: create_service(), add_item(), and publish_item().\nARCGIS_CLIENT and ARCGIS_SECRET environment variables are used only in the auth_client() OAuth2 client flow authorization. See the article on authorization for more.\nARCGIS_TOKEN is used to fetch a users access token. These are retrieved using the various auth_ functions of arcgisutils and set using set_auth_token(). Alternatively, the ARCGIS_TOKEN can be set to an API key.\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting your credentials in .Renviron\nEnvironment variables should never be included in your code. Instead, they should be stored in an external environment file such as an .Renvrion file. To modify your .Renviron run the following in your text editor\nusethis::edit_r_environ()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.Renviron scopes\n\n\n\n\n\n.Renviron files can be created at a user level or a project level. It is recommended to use project level .Renviron files when deploying scripts to production. If most of your work is interactive then a user level file is sufficient.\nProject scoped .Renviron files store environment variables that are available for the project only. The .Renviron is stored at the root folder level.\nUser scoped .Renviron files store environment variables in the user’s home directory. The environment variables will be available to you in any project you open. However, if you share your project, the environment variables will not be shared with it.\n\n\n\nYou .Renviron file will now be opened for you to edit.

It is not the Label column.\n\n\nFor example, if we wanted to parse the date parameter we could write our function like so:\ntool_exec &lt;- function(in_params, out_params) {\n  # fetch the date parameter\n  date_str &lt;- in_params[[\"date\"]]\n  \n  # parse it using {anytime}\n  clean_date &lt;- anytime::anytime(date_str)\n  \n  # ... do additional things\n  \n  # return values to ArcGIS Pro\n  out_params\n}\n\nReturning values to ArcGIS Pro\nYou may have noticed that at the end of the tool_exec() function we are returning the out_params object. If we do not return the output parameters back to Pro—by returning out_params—the outputs cannot be captured and used by Pro.\nNotably, the output parameters are useful in linking one tool to another, for example via use in ModelBuilder or in an arcpy script.\nSee Using R script tools with arcpy\n\n\nParameter types\nThere are number of different type of parameters that can be provided to a geoprocessing (GP) tool. The type of parameter that is chosen determines how that parameter will appear in the GP pane’s UI. Each parameter type can be represented by a basic scalar R type: integer, double, character, logical, or NULL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA scalar value is a vector with only a single element.\n\n\nIt is incumbent upon you to take these parameter inputs and use them appropriately in R. Not every type of parameter can be processed correctly by arcgisbinding. Below are some of the most common parameter types and how they are handled by arcgisbinding. This is not a complete enumeration by any means!\n\nData type mapping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter Data Type\nR type\n\n\n\n\nString\ncharacter\n\n\nBoolean\nlogical\n\n\nDouble\nnumeric\n\n\nDate\ncharacter in the format of your system e.g. \"11/17/2023 4:35:57 PM\"\n\n\nField\ncharacter the field name of a feature class\n\n\nFolder\ncharacter absolute path e.g. \"C:\\\\Users\\username\\Documents\"\n\n\nFeature Class\ncharacterabsolute path e.g. \"C:\\\\Users\\username\\mydatabase.gdb\\\\feature_class\n\n\nSpatial Reference\ncharacter a string representation of the spatial reference e.g. \"PROJCS[\"....\"]\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Values\nWhen selecting the Multiple values check box in the parameter data type UI, users can then provide multiple inputs of that type.\n\nWhen this is done, each of the input values will be contained inside of a list. If you have multiple values ticked for the String type, you will get a list of scalar character vectors.\nThis is important so it bears repeating! When users provide multiple values they will be captured in R as a list of scalars. Meaning that if you have multiple String values you will not get a character vector with a length greater than one.\nTake the below input for example\n\nIn R we would get the list(\"string 1\", \"string 2\") and not c(\"string 1\", \"string 2\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo turn a list of scalars of the same type—e.g. double, integer, logical, or character—into a vector you can use unlist(). For example unlist(list(\"string 1\", \"string 2\")) will give us c(\"string 1\", \"string 2\")."

    "section": "Common Patterns",
    "text": "Common Patterns\n\nReading a Feature Class\nOften we you will want to read a feature class using arcgisbinding and bring the results into R as an sf object. To do his we will use the functions arc.open(), arc.select(), and arc.data2sf().\ntool_exec &lt;- function(in_params, out_params) {\n\n  fclass &lt;- arcgisbinding::arc.open(in_params[[\"fc_path\"]])\n  \n  fclass_selected &lt;- arcgisbinding::arc.select(\n    fclass,\n    # fields = c(\"optional\", \"fields\", \"to\", \"read\"),\n    # where_clause = \"optional sql where clause to filter\"\n  )\n  \n  fclass_sf &lt;- arcgisbinding::arc.data2sf(fclass_selected)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are going to filter or select columns from your dataset consider doing that with the fields and where_clause arguments of arc.select() to reduce the amount of data read into memory.\narc.select() returns a data.frame with fields and a special geometry column which is incompatible with sf. We use arc.data2sf() to convert it to an sf object.\n\n\n\n\nWriting a Feature Class\nIt is quite common to write the results of an analysis to a file geodatabase. This can be done with arc.write(). Typically, the we will capture the output path to write to in the out_params list object as a Feature Class type parameter.\narc.write() requires two arguments. The first is the output path to write to and the second is the object to write. The accepted type of objects are data.frame, sf, RasterLayer or RasterBrick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs of Nov 2023 {terra} is not supported but we are actively working on this.\n\n\ntool_exec &lt;- function(in_params, out_params) {\n  \n  # extract the path to write to\n  out_fp &lt;- out_params[[\"output_fclass\"]]\n  \n  # write the `sf_object` to a geodatabase\n  arcgisbinding::arc.write(out_fp, sf_object)\n  \n}\n\n\nInstalling Required Packages\nWhen you share your R based GP tools with other users there is a good chance that they do not have the packages that your script tool needs to execute code. In this case, we should install the required packages the first time the script tool is executed.\nIn our script tool we should check to see if the required package is installed and if not, install it. We can write a helper function to include at the top of our script if we have multiple packages to check.\ninstall_if_not &lt;- function(pkg) {\n  if (!requireNamespace(pkg)) {\n    message(\"Installing required package `{\", pkg, \"}`\")\n    install.packages(pkg)\n  }\n}\nThis function uses requireNamespace() which attempts to load the provided package. If it succeeds, it returns TRUE, if not it returns FALSE. We check to see if it returns FALSE and if so, we install the package and print an informative message.\nFor example if we need to use the package {spdep} and its not installed it will print the message and install it.\ntool_exec &lt;- function(in_params, out_params) {\n  # check for required paackages \n  install_if_not(\"spdep\")\n  \n  # do other thigns with spdep\n  # ...\n}"

Using arc.progress_pos() allows control over the progressor position displayed at the top of the running script.

This is very handy in the case of very, very, massive Feature Layers with hundreds of thousands of features. Reading all of those features into memory would be slow, costly (in terms of memory), and unnecessary!\nThe where argument of arc_select() permits us to provide a very simple SQL where clause to limit what we get back. Let’s explore the use of the where argument.\nLet’s modify our above arc_select() statement to return only the features in California. We do this by using the where clause STATE_ABBR = 'CA'\n\narc_select(\n  flayer,\n  where = \"STATE_ABBR = 'CA'\",\n  fields = c(\"STATE_ABBR\", \"POPULATION\", \"NAME\")\n)\n\nSimple feature collection with 498 features and 3 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -124.1662 ymin: 32.57388 xmax: -114.5903 ymax: 40.93734\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\nFirst 10 features:\n   STATE_ABBR POPULATION         NAME                   geometry\n1          CA      38046     Adelanto  POINT (-117.4384 34.5792)\n2          CA      20299 Agoura Hills POINT (-118.7601 34.15363)\n3          CA      78280      Alameda  POINT (-122.2614 37.7672)\n4          CA      15314        Alamo POINT (-122.0307 37.84998)\n5          CA      20271       Albany POINT (-122.3002 37.88985)\n6          CA      82868     Alhambra POINT (-118.1355 34.08398)\n7          CA      52176  Aliso Viejo POINT (-117.7289 33.57922)\n8          CA      14696       Alpine POINT (-116.7585 32.84388)\n9          CA      42846     Altadena POINT (-118.1356 34.19342)\n10         CA      12042    Alum Rock  POINT (-121.8239 37.3694)\n\n\nWe can also consider finding only the places in the US with more than 1,000,000 people as well.\n\narc_select(\n  flayer,\n  where = \"POPULATION &gt; 1000000\",\n  fields = c(\"STATE_ABBR\", \"POPULATION\", \"NAME\")\n)\n\nSimple feature collection with 10 features and 3 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -121.8864 ymin: 29.42354 xmax: -74.01013 ymax: 41.75649\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n   STATE_ABBR POPULATION         NAME                   geometry\n1          AZ    1608139      Phoenix POINT (-112.0739 33.44611)\n2          CA    3898747  Los Angeles POINT (-118.2706 34.05279)\n3          CA    1386932    San Diego POINT (-117.1456 32.72033)\n4          CA    1013240     San Jose POINT (-121.8864 37.33941)\n5          IL    2746388      Chicago POINT (-87.64715 41.75649)\n6          NY    8804190     New York POINT (-74.01013 40.71057)\n7          PA    1603797 Philadelphia POINT (-75.16099 39.95136)\n8          TX    1304379       Dallas POINT (-96.79576 32.77865)\n9          TX    2304580      Houston POINT (-95.36751 29.75876)\n10         TX    1434625  San Antonio  POINT (-98.4925 29.42354)\n\n\nNow let’s try combining both where clauses using and to find only the cities in California with a population greater than 1,000,000.\n\narc_select(\n  flayer,\n  where = \"POPULATION &gt; 1000000 and STATE_ABBR = 'CA'\",\n  fields = c(\"STATE_ABBR\", \"POPULATION\", \"NAME\")\n)\n\nSimple feature collection with 3 features and 3 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -121.8864 ymin: 32.72033 xmax: -117.1456 ymax: 37.33941\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n  STATE_ABBR POPULATION        NAME                   geometry\n1         CA    3898747 Los Angeles POINT (-118.2706 34.05279)\n2         CA    1386932   San Diego POINT (-117.1456 32.72033)\n3         CA    1013240    San Jose POINT (-121.8864 37.33941)"

The general concept is that we have a connection object that specifies what we will be querying against. Then we build up our queries using dplyr functions. Unlike using dplyr on data.frames, the results aren’t fetched eagerly. Instead they are lazy. With dbplyr we use the collect() function to execute a query and bring it into memory.
