title: "Authorize with your Portal"

In order to read content items that do not have a "Public" Sharing level (![](images/sharing-public.png){width=30%}), or to write to or modify existing content items that you are an owner of, you will need to be authorized. 

[Authorization is done using OAuth2](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/oauth-2.0/). There are two ways to authorize with OAuth2: either by using a a `code` or a `client` flow. In most cases code based authorization is recommended. These two methods are explained below. 

Before you can authorize, you must first create a client ID. 

## Obtaining a Client ID

If a client ID is not provided to you by an administrator and you have the ability to create content items, you can create one. 

You can do so by creating an application item. 

- Log in to your ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise organization
- Navigate to the Content tab
- Click `New Item`
- Select `Application` 

![](images/content-app.png){width=50%}

- Choose `Other application` as your `Application Type`
- Give the item an informative name such as `r-arcgis`
    - Optionally, specify the folder, tags, and summary as well.

- You will be directed to the item details page of the newly created application where you can see your credentials. **Do not share these**.

## Securing your credentials

By default, packages in the `{arcgis}` metapackage are configured to work with ArcGIS Online. `arcgis` utilizes environment variables to determine how requests are crafted and where requests are made. These environment variables are: 

- `ARCGIS_HOST`
- `ARCGIS_CLIENT`
- `ARCGIS_USER`
- `ARCGIS_SECRET`
- `ARCGIS_TOKEN`

:::{.callout-note collapse="true" title="Environment variable descriptions"}
- **`ARCGIS_HOST`** is used to to determine where authorization takes place. By default, this is `"https://www.arcgis.com"`. This is because the packages, by default, interact with ArcGIS Online. To use a different portal, you will need to modify the `ARCGIS_HOST` path to url of that portal. 

- **`ARCGIS_USER`** variable is used to determine who actions are performed on behalf of. Notably, it is used in functions that modify or create resource such as functions from `arcgislayers`: `create_service()`, `add_item()`, and `publish_item()`.

- **`ARCGIS_CLIENT`** and **`ARCGIS_SECRET`** environment variables are used only in the `auth_client()` OAuth2 client flow authorization. See the [article on authorization](https://r-arcgis.github.io/arcgislayers/articles/Authorization.html) for more. 

- **`ARCGIS_TOKEN`** is used to fetch a users access token. These are retrieved using the various `auth_` functions of `arcgisutils` and set using `set_auth_token()`. Alternatively, the `ARCGIS_TOKEN` can be set to an API key. 
:::

### Setting your credentials in `.Renviron`

Environment variables should _**never**_ be included in your code. Instead, they should be stored in an external environment file such as an `.Renvrion` file. To modify your `.Renviron`, you can use the `usethis` package. Ensure it is installed and run the following in your text editor:

```r
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```
:::{.callout-tip title="`.Renviron` scopes" collapse="true"}
`.Renviron` files can be created at a user level or a project level. It is recommended to use project level `.Renviron` files when deploying scripts to production. If most of your work is interactive then a user level file is sufficient. 

**Project scoped** `.Renviron` files store environment variables that are available for the project _only_. The `.Renviron` is stored at the root folder level.

**User scoped** `.Renviron` files store environment variables in the user's home directory. The environment variables will be available to you in any project you open. However, if you share your project, the environment variables will not be shared with it.
:::

This will open your `.Renviron` file for you to edit. Fill in the environment variables `ARCGIS_CLIENT` and `ARCGIS_SECRET` from the content item we just created. If you are not using ArcGIS Online, ensure that your portal's host is provided to `ARCGIS_HOST`. Additionally, provide your username to `ARCGIS_USER` if you plan to publish or edit existing content.

```bash
ARCGIS_CLIENT=your-client-id
ARCGIS_SECRET=your-super-secret-key
ARCGIS_HOST=https://your-portal.com/
ARCGIS_USER=your-user-name
```
:::{.callout-warning}
Do not put environment variable values in quotation marks.

If you are using ArcGIS Online, you do not need to set the environment variable `ARCGIS_HOST`.
:::

Be sure to save your changes to the file. To register the new environment variables restart your R session. 

## Authorizing

First, load the library. 

```r
library(arcgis)
#> Attaching core arcgis packages:
#>   - {arcgisutils} v0.1.0
#>   - {arcgislayers} v0.1.0
```

### Code flow

The OAuth2 Code Flow is a process where a user authorizes an application to act on its behalf by granting a temporary access token. This type of authorization permits the application to take actions on the users behalf for the duration of the access token. Learn more about how [ArcGIS uses OAuth2.0](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/oauth-2/).

Running `auth_code()` will open a tab in your browser to begin the code flow. If you are authorizing to an ArcGIS Enterprise portal ensure that you set the `ARCGIS_HOST` environment variable correctly and that you have restarted your R session. 

```r
token <- auth_code()
```
You will be prompted to sign in to your portal. 

![](images/oauth-sign-in.png){width=50%}

Once you've signed in, copy the code that appears, and return to R. Enter the code into the console without any modifications and press enter. 

![](images/oauth-code.png){width=70%}

Your authorization will have completed. 

```r
token
#> <httr2_token>
#> token_type: bearer
#> access_token: <REDACTED>
#> expires_at: 2023-03-03 13:21:40
#> refresh_token: <REDACTED>
#> username: your-user
#> ssl: TRUE
#> refresh_token_expires_in: 1209599
```

We now need to set this token to the `ARCGIS_SECRET` environment variable. We do this with `set_auth_token()`. 

```r
set_auth_token(token)
#> Token set to environment variable `ARCGIS_TOKEN`
```


### Client flow

Alternatively, we can authorize using the client OAuth2 flow. This will authorize the application we created and not ourselves. Because of this we cannot use the client flow to create or modify content. 

The client flow has the benefit of being non-interactive, though. 

```r
token <- auth_client()
set_auth_token(token)
#> Token set to environment variable `ARCGIS_TOKEN`
```

### Using ArcGIS Pro & `{arcgisbinding}`

If you are a user of ArcGIS Pro and have **arcgisbinding** installed, you can use `auth_binding()` to utilize the tokens that result from `arc.check_portal()`. `auth_binding()` has the benefit of being non-interactive _and_ authorizes you as a user. You can use `auth_binding()` for non-interactive work that creates or modifies existing content.

```r
token <- auth_binding()
set_auth_token(token)
#> Token set to environment variable `ARCGIS_TOKEN`
```
