# Use ArcGIS Location Services 

The **`arcgis`** package for location services meets developers where they are at. At it's core, **`arcgis`** is a collection of R packages designed to interact with [ArcGIS Location Services](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/) all from the comfort of R and your text editor. 

ArcGIS Location Services are provided as REST API endpoints and **`arcgis`** makes interacting with the services using R native objects seamless.

# Interact with ArcGIS Pro

`{arcgisbinding}`, the first package created for the R-ArcGIS Bridge, is designed to bind the powers of R and ArcGIS. Using `{arcgisbinding}` you can read and write local data sources and take advantage of ArcGIS Pro's [projection engine](https://github.com/Esri/projection-engine-db-doc). 

Read and write local data sources with [`arc.write()`](https://r.esri.com/assets/arcgisbinding.pdf) and [`arc.open()`](https://r.esri.com/assets/arcgisbinding.pdf). Convert to `{sf}` and `{raster}` objects with [`arc.data2sf()`](https://r.esri.com/assets/arcgisbinding.pdf) and [`arc.raster()`](https://r.esri.com/assets/arcgisbinding.pdf). Or, create [geoprocessing script tools that use R](geoprocessing-tools.qmd).
