_Building bridges between 
<br>the R and ArcGIS ecosystems_ 
:::
<hr>

The R-ArcGIS Bridge enables ArcGIS users to enrich their workflows by accessing thousands of open-source data science and statistical packages in R.
It also helps R users extend their analyses by accessing the authoritative datasets, mapping and visualization capabilities, and advanced spatial analytics of ArcGIS.

# Use ArcGIS Location Services 

The **`arcgis`** meta-package for location services brings ArcGIS to data scientists, analysts, and developers where they work. At it's core, **`arcgis`** is a collection of R packages designed to interact with [ArcGIS Location Services](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/) all from the comfort of R and your text editor. 

ArcGIS Location Services are provided as REST API endpoints and **`arcgis`** makes interacting with the services using R native objects seamless.

<!-- 
Nick: Below this, suggest a bulleted list of a few of the location services, using the language of the developers doc:
- Data hosting
- Geocoding
- Routing

Josiah: we only support data hosting so we cannot mention any of these other options

# Interact with ArcGIS Pro

`{arcgisbinding}`, the first package created for the R-ArcGIS Bridge, is designed to bind the powers of R and ArcGIS Pro. Using `{arcgisbinding}` you can read and write local data sources and take advantage of ArcGIS Pro's [projection engine](https://github.com/Esri/projection-engine-db-doc) or create [geoprocessing script tools that use R](geoprocessing-tools.qmd). 

_Get started by [installing `{arcgisbinding}`.](arcgisbinding/installing-arcgisbinding.qmd)_
